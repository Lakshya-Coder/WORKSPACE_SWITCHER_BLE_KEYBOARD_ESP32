## Features
- Switches the workspace when the joystick moves up and down
- Play/pause the media when the joystick button (swButton) is pressed

## Remaining Tasks:
- [ ] Making a more refined version of this prototype that is usable and stable
- [ ] Making this more like a macropod which is also customizable
- [ ] Formaing a simple, sleek version of this with the help of the PCB, 3rd printing
